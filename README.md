# LCB_AppleAudioUnitMIDIInstrument

A LiveCode Builder Module that binds to Apple's AVAudioUnitMIDIInstrument allowing the loading of arbitrary Music Device AU Plug-ins such as Apple's DLSSynth and many others.

Version 0.1:
Built off of my LCB_AppleAVAudioSampler project, this one retrieves a list of all Music Device AU Plugs available in the system and allows loading for sending MIDI commands. Does NOT retrieve a list of Factory Presets yet (working on it).
